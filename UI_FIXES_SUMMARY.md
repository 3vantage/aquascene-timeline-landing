# UI Fixes Summary Report

## Issues Identified and Resolved

### 1. **Label Overlapping Issues** ✅ FIXED
**Problem**: Form field labels were overlapping with input content due to incorrect positioning
- Labels were positioned at `y: -12px` causing overlap with placeholder text
- Labels appeared inside input fields making them unreadable

**Solution**: 
- Updated label positioning to `y: -20px` for proper separation
- Modified CSS classes to position labels at `-top-2` when focused/filled
- Added proper background handling for different variants

**Files Modified**:
- `/src/components/ui/Input.tsx`
- `/src/components/ui/Select.tsx`

### 2. **Poor Text Contrast** ✅ FIXED  
**Problem**: Labels and text had poor contrast making them difficult to read
- Labels used `text-white/70` resulting in low contrast
- Some text appeared too faded on glass backgrounds

**Solution**:
- Changed label colors from `text-white/70` to `text-white` for unfocused state
- Updated focused state from `text-accent-emerald` to `text-cyan-300` for better visibility
- Enhanced checkbox labels from `text-white/90` to `text-white`

**Files Modified**:
- `/src/components/ui/Input.tsx`
- `/src/components/ui/Select.tsx` 
- `/src/components/ui/Checkbox.tsx`

### 3. **Form Variant Inconsistency** ✅ FIXED
**Problem**: Form components were using default variant instead of glass variant
- Components defaulted to white backgrounds inappropriate for the design
- Inconsistent styling across form elements

**Solution**:
- Updated WaitlistForm to explicitly use `variant="glass"` for all form components
- Ensured consistent glass styling across Input, Select, and Checkbox components
- Removed custom className overrides in favor of proper variant usage

**Files Modified**:
- `/src/components/forms/WaitlistForm.tsx`

### 4. **Label Background Issues** ✅ FIXED
**Problem**: Labels needed proper backgrounds for visibility when positioned outside inputs

**Solution**:
- Added conditional background styling based on variant
- Default variant gets `bg-white` background for labels
- Glass/underwater variants get transparent backgrounds to maintain design aesthetics
